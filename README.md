## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze CNBC headlines and predict stock market movements. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `cnbc_headlines.csv`: Contains CNBC headlines with timestamps and descriptions.
- `Schincke_DSC550_Termproject.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data analysis and prediction modeling.
- `src/Stock Market Movement Prediction.docx`: Documentation of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Other dependencies as listed in the Jupyter notebook

### Installation
